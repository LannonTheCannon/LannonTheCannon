- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lannon. I wrote most of my code in order to develop tools and interactive software for a class that i'm teaching in Python.
I felt that the best way to teach was to develop something users could interact with in real time. I see now that this software project 
can continue to grow in a way that is professional and streamlined. So here I am, my next real step in programming.
